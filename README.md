# File Handling - Square of even & Cube of odd

A Python program that contains a method that will create two separate text files after reading the source text file named integers.txt, which contains 20 integers. The first output file will be named double.txt, containing the square of all even integers found in integers.txt, and the second file will be named triple.txt, containing the cube of all odd numbers found in integers.txt.

## Program Instructions
The user will be asked to input the integers; thus, numbers.txt may be created automatically.

The output will be written in plain text files that will be created once the program is run, where:      

  - The square of even integers will be on double.txt.
  - The cube of odd integers will be on triple.txt.

The outputs will also be displayed in a new window using tkinter.

## Installation
  git bash installation:

      git clone [link]

      cd [project name]

      npm install

  Or, to smoothly run the program, install or download the following modules:

 * colorama (pip install colorama)
 * tkinter (pip install tk)
 * PIl (pip install Pillow)
(easiest way to install is through pip)
